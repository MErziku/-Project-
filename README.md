COVID-19 Global Data Tracker
Project Description
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to track cases, deaths, recoveries, and vaccinations across countries and over time. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization of trends, and generation of insights about the pandemic's progression.

Objectives
Import and clean COVID-19 global data from reliable sources

Analyze time trends for cases, deaths, and vaccinations

Compare metrics across countries and regions

Visualize trends with charts and interactive maps

Generate meaningful insights about the pandemic's impact

Create a comprehensive report suitable for presentation

Tools and Libraries Used
Python: Core programming language

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: Numerical computing

Matplotlib: Basic data visualization

Seaborn: Statistical data visualization

Plotly: Interactive visualizations and choropleth maps

Jupyter: Interactive development environment

How to Run/View the Project

Using Python Script in Spyder/IDE
Install required packages:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly
Open the covid_19_global_tracker.py file in Spyder or any Python IDE

Run the script

View visualizations in the "visualizations" folder and console output

Insights and Reflections
Key Insights from the Analysis
Global Impact Patterns: COVID-19 affected countries worldwide, but with varying intensity. Developed nations generally reported higher case numbers, though this may reflect testing capacity differences.

Death Rate Trends: Death rates were highest in the early stages of the pandemic. Improvements in treatment and vaccination led to declining death rates over time. Countries with older populations tended to have higher death rates.

Vaccination Disparities: Significant disparities existed in vaccination rates between continents. Wealthier nations achieved higher vaccination rates more quickly, while Africa lagged behind other continents.

Socioeconomic Factors: Higher GDP per capita correlated with better healthcare outcomes. Countries with better healthcare infrastructure (more hospital beds) had lower death rates. Population density showed a moderate correlation with case rates.

Regional Variations: Different regions experienced pandemic waves at different times. Response measures and public health policies varied significantly between countries.
